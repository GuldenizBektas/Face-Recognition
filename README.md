This face recognation model created with OpenCV's built in functions. The results are not perfect because of that. In near future, I'll add more images to predict more accurate.

Used 5 classes of famous people to train.

Faces > train - val

**Classes:**
1. Ben Afflek
2. Elton John
3. Jerry Seinfield
4. Madonna
5. Mindy Kaling

## Dependencies
* OpenCV Contrib library. OpenCV, and OpenCV contrib libraries are not the same. OpenCV contains main modules, OpenCV contrib contains both main modules and contrib/extra modules. My installation took so long, and I had to use Google Colab for this, so I used `matplotlib` library to display the image.
  ```bash
  pip3 install opencv-contrib-python
  ```
* Matplotlib
  ```bash
  pip3 install matplotlib
  ```
* Numpy
  ```bash
  pip3 install numpy
  ```
* OS
